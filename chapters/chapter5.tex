\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
        \section{Conclusion}
        We successfully completed the following work areas, including their simulations and hardware representation:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item 5V Supply for Microcontroller Power Supply.
				
				\item Zero Crossing Circuit for detection of Zero Voltage instant of AC supply.
				
				\item Firing pulse generation based on Zero Crossing Circuit fed as input to microcontroller.
				
				\item On/Off and dimming control of lamp and fan using Optoisolators and Triac.
				
				\item Android application for managing and control of lamp.
			\end{enumerate}
        \section{Future Work}
        The project can involve further development of-
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Plug and Play modules for AC and other household appliances.
			
			\item Machine Learning based autonomy algorithms.
			
			\item A centralised Home Automation Software to coordinate between various switchboard modules and house the machine learning algorithms.
			
			\item Sensor Aggregator Modules to provide environmental parameters to the device
		\end{itemize}
