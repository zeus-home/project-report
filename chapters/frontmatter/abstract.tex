    A Smart Switch Board is a compact and efficient replacement of conventional switchboard, which provides the automated control to the user. It ensures the user convenience and energy saving via modern control strategy and power electronic devices. In addition, the unnecessary wastages of electricity can be prevented by controlling the appliances even from outside the house.\\
    
    The switches are made in modular fashion which provides the provision for scalability of the product as the user can increase the number of devices connected over time.  So it can be put forward for the commercialization purpose.\\
    
    The existing products available in the market requires replacement of the existing devices with the new smart devices which is quite costly and also the existing devices carry no use after that. The smart switch just upgrades the conventional switch boards and the existing devices then can be controlled over the internet.\\
    
    In this project we provide a 5V supply to the input of the microcontroller which provides gating signals to the driver circuit. A zero cross detection circuit is formed for calculating the time at which the rectified voltage reaches zero. Feeding these values in the microcontroller, it fires interrupts to flag the initiation of counter which provides delayed pulse according to the input provided by the user. Simulation and PCB design of the Circuit were made in Orcad Cadence Software.\\
